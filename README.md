## 🔧 Currently Building

### 🎯 [`miniRT`](https://github.com/dreule/miniRT) (in progress)
A beginner-friendly ray tracer written in C using MLX42.  
Working with [@gzovkic](https://github.com/gzovkic) once again to simulate light, shadows, and 3D objects using math—not magic.

> ☀️ Features in progress: ambient & diffuse lighting, object intersection, camera rotation  
> 🔁 Objects: planes, spheres, cylinders — and soon, maybe more...
